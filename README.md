mobile application to help you manage your medical prescriptions

## how this application will help me

This application will help you save your medical prescriptions in a structured way on your phone (with a photo of the prescription), and allows you to see at a glance which prescriptions are in progress or out of date.

This system greatly simplifies the management of prescriptions that have to be renewed.

So you have a list of your prescriptions, a form for adding them, and a page dedicated to "about us".
